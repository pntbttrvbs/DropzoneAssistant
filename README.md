# DropzoneAssistant

Dropzone Assistant is a suite of Python applications to help Dropzone Commander players manage their figurines and armies. I've set up this open-source project in Python so that it can be easily maintained and modified by the community. Additionally, by using [Kivy](http://kivy.org) for graphics support, it should be easily compatible with Android, iOS, Windows, OSX, and Linux.

StatViewer is a simple app to view unit stats. Unit core stats were taken from the [2018 Michigan GT spreadsheet](http://michigangt.com/2017/09/rules-update-dropzone-dropfleet-player-packets/).

ArmyBuilder is a remake of the ["Fighting Forces of the Reconquest"](http://www.dzc-ffor.com/) army builder. This will include new unit stats and be modified to fit the [Dropzone Commander 2.4.1](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0965/1274/files/Dropzone_Commander_Rulebook_2.4.1.pdf?12289528169112885107) army building rules. I am hoping to release this in February 2019. I am planning to include a utility to import FFoR army lists.
